# SoftwareEngineering

These are a set of C++ solutions to tasks as part of my software engineering module at university.

Task 1: I was tasked with creating solutions to make a series of tests pass. These solutions also had to be implemened efficiently

Task 2: Extremly poor quality code that still pased all the given tests was handed to me and I was tasked with refactoring it while still making all tests pass.
This code was so bad it included unused variables as well as variables with poor naming that were used multiple times doing different
things each time and in some cases doing nothing. It was not modular and included unneccesary looping and comments that would describe the code
as doing something different to what it was actually doing.

Task 3: Code was given to me and I had to test it. I am extremly proud of this one as the code I was handed was supposed to be fully functional
however I found a bug through testing that my module leader was not aware of.
